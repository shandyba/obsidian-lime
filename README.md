# UnLime

UnLime is a tiny Obsidian plugin adding a functionality of toggling the visibility of "Unlinked mentions" sections within standard Obsidian **Backlinks** and **Outgoing Links** panels.

## Why

Working with large vaults with a diverse set of notes creates lots of _false positives_ under "Unlinked mentions".
Using **Backlinks** and **Outgoing Links** panels while constantly seeing those irrelevant entries can be distractful. I created this to keep my workspace cleaner and less cluttered.

## How

1. In Obsidian, open "Settings" and navigate to "Community plugins"
1. Click "Browse" and search for "Obsidian Lime"
1. Click "Install"
1. In the "Installed plugins" section enable "Obsidian Lime"
1. Go to "Obsidian Lime" plugin settings and switch ON toggels to hide "Unlinked mentions", separately for **Backlinks** and **Outgoing links** panels

## What's next

This is likely very fragile, but it works and has been tested on Macos Obsidian desktop version 1.8.10.
I'm not able to verify this for other platforms and it could be challenging for me to maintain compatibility with future versions.
Contributions are welcomed.
